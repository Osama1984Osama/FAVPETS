      "  When I was recently at the racehorse training center, I noticed most of the horse looked very young. Seeing all these colts and fillies made me wonder about the age racehorses begin their career. Horses are broke to the saddle and begin their racehorse training when they are two-years-old. The first two-year-old races usually start in the late spring. Track rules do not allow a horse less than two years old in a sanctioned competition .The rules that govern horse racing require a horse to be two years old to run in a race. But in actual months, he could only be 18 months old. Let me explain; horses are all given the same date of birth, January 1, of the year they are born . We know horses are born throughout the year, but most breeders try to have their foals delivered as close to this date as practical, but still, some will be born as late as May.",

      " No other animal can match the contributions that horses have made to human civilization. What makes horses such good partners for people? Horses cannot learn the way people do; training horses involves working with their natural instincts, not trying to change them. But fortunately for us, most of the qualities that make horses helpful to humans were already present in wild horses. Their bodies are powerful, living machines that can work all day, powered only by grass. And their brains give them both the ability to understand subtle commands and the motivation to obey them.",

      "  Let’s clear up a common misunderstanding about horses: they do not sleep standing up. They snooze standing up. There’s a big difference.Horses, like humans and, in fact, all land mammals, require deep sleep for proper mental and physical functioning. But for a prey species like the horse, whose existence in the wild depends on its ability to outrun predators, deep sleep can be a serious threat to personal safety. So how do horses get enough sleep?For starters, horses doze a lot. On any given day, drive past a pasture of horses and count how many are grazing and how many are just standing there, heads down, lower lips drooping. Those are your snoozers, standing up",

      " A horse can, in fact, drink too much water, particularly if he suffers from certain health conditions, such as equine Cushing’s disease. Such ailments can cause a horse to exhibit polydipsia, or excessive drinking behavior.Excessive water intake can cause stress on the kidneys as they eliminate the excess water and can also dilute the electrolytes in the horse’s body, decreasing its ability to regulate temperature,” Janicki explains.",

We can forgive the people who truly don't know any better, but it's always best to know as much as possible about your horse's sleeping habits.
